In this class will go over the basic concepts of arrays

> Arrays in general is a set of (usually) same type elements/objects that ate stored under the same name.
> In C, you have to specify the size during the compile time, meaning when you write the code
> In C++ size can be determined either in compile time or run time(ask user for it)
> benefits of it is to make search and sort easier because all stored in ""contiguous"" memory location
  meaning if store char then the the addresses of each char move by one bit (see my note)
